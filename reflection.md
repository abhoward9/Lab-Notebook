## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

Much of this week was review for me, as HTML was my introduction to programming many years ago.
It was a good refresher, and I certainly learned some new concepts like associating controls of a form together and building a table.
As this was mostly a review, I didn't feel like any of the explanations were lacking.

### Accessibility

Web browser Accessibility was a new topic for me. Most of my previous experience with Accessibility
features came from the feature that are baked into iOS, so learning how to make accessible webpages
and audit those accessibility features with tools like WAVE are certainly things that I will take with me into the future.
I did feel like there could have been more of a focus on the things that tools like WAVE do not catch, since it was mentioned that
it only catches about 30% of accessibility issues. I also would have liked more of a focus on ARIA labels.

### CSS

Like HTML, CSS was part of my introduction to programming, but it was always a bit of a stumbling block for me. I understood that
it focused on the design of the page where HTML was what defined the content, and I understood basic concepts like the fact that a selector would
influence all HTML tags of that kind, but the more advanced topics like pseudo classes (or even why an HTML tag should get more than one class)
were always lost on me. These exercies helped me understand these concepts and more, and have also helped me identify some issues with my company's website.
I did have to follow along with the videos pretty directly, and afterward I did play around with the things I learned in this exercise, but I do think a more open ended exercise would have aided in my learning here, and I think a short intro into CSS animations would have been fun (but then again I am a big fan of animation in general).

### Flexbox

I had to follow along with the videos very carefully here. And I'm still not sure that I am confident with things like containers.
I understand it in the context of the exercise but I feel like I would have difficulty recreating it at the moment, or knowing which flex type I would want to use if I was looking to achieve a given outcome. I will certainly be hanging on to these exercises for reference.
I think that a helpful exercise here (and most anything CSS related) would be where the student is given well constructed style sheets/html pages and
asked to do exercises where they must examine the page in dev tools and answer some questions based on what they find in there.

### CSS Grid

I had to follow the videos closely for this one, and honestly looking back on it as I am writing this, I don't think I have really internalized what is going on. While the videos were indeed helpful, I think playing around with real content instead of of just placeholder boxes might have helped me understand a bit more about how this is used in practice. I can see where it would be useful, and I would imagine it is used extensively in many popular websites, but maybe examing a popular website that uses it as part of this exercise would have been helpful.

### Bootstrap

Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?
❏ How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?
❏ Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
❏ Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
topic a little better?

I found the grid to be fairly intuitive, although given that humans tend to be more comfortable when working with things that are divisible by 10 I was initially a bit confounded as to why the grid was divided into 12 columns. As of writing this I cannot remember if this was mentioned in the videos, but when I researched why bootstrap went with 12 columns, the fact that 12 is easily divisible by several different factors (2,3,4,6) really made it clear why they went with that.
I also find it somewhat fascinating that something like bootstrap offers so much for absolutely no cost. While I can't think of anything that would have helped me learn this topic better, I am curious to know what else is out there as alternatives to bootstrap and why I might pick those over boostrap or vice versa.

### javascript

For some reason, Javscript has always failed to click for me, and I don't actually know why, because I rarely have no trouble internalizing concepts for other programming languages like Python and C++. I think it may be becuase there are a lot concepts of functions in javascript that are somewhat foreign compared to other languages. While researching javascript for this section, it also appears that object oriented concepts are a fairly recent addition to javascript, having only been added in 2016. OOP really resonates with my way of thinking about programming, and I started learning C++ around that time whereas I was introduced to Javascript before that, so I think maybe a bit more emphasis on that, as many people taking this class will be fresh out of CS 302 and it will make the transition into using this language a bit easier.

### jquery

Jquery was another topic where I feel like I understand the individual pieces but I'm having trouble with the bigger picture. I felt like I struggled heavily with HW3 and had to follow these exercises in the Javascript and Jquery labs very closely into get the correct results. I don't really have a suggestion for what exercises could be included, I just need to get more practice with it.
